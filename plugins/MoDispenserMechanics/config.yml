  # If tools are breakable, what should the plugin do when a tool would normally break?
  # values can be:
  #   BREAK - break the tool normally
  #   DROP - drop the tool on the ground
  #   JAM - do nothing "jam up"
  #   UNBREAKABLE - tools do not take any durability damage to begin with
  tool durability option: BREAK
  # Should MoDispenserMechanics fire Dispense events for its custom mechanics?
  # Setting this to false will yield slightly better performance.
  # If you wish to prevent unnecessary CoreProtect container logs set this to false.
  dispense events: true
  # Should we not pre-cancel events caused by the fake player?
  # Setting this to true will cause plugins to handle events caused by the fake player, such as attack, item use etc.
  # While this can help with integration (such as tree-feller plugins working with it) it can also cause
  # issues as the fake player isn't a perfect implementation of a real player.
  # Only enable this option .
  # You can edit permissions for the fake player via it's UUID: 657912a8-aa0e-3f17-aff5-a41f440e710c
